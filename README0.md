I am ready to get to work! Since I don't want to guess which of your interests is front-of-mind tonight, help me narrow down the vibe so we can pick the right focus.
What is your energy level for this evening?
 * High Focus (Coding/Building): Do you want to dive deep into code, solve a complex logic problem, or build out a specific feature?
 * Creative (Design/Visuals): Are you in the mood to work on UI layouts, logos, or branding concepts?
 * Strategic (Planning/Learning): Would you rather brainstorm features, outline a roadmap, or perhaps learn a new concept?
Would you like to pick up where we left off on a specific past project, or start something entirely new?
